  <h1>My Goals</h1>
  <br>
  <p>
    1. Why do I want to learn this skill?
    What does it mean to you? What are your motivations? Will you prove something to yourself or
    people around you? Will you get a raise because youâ€™re better at your job or will you get a better job?
    <br>
    <li>I'm a very Competetive person that is driven by watching my peers suceed. To me, Im motived by my late start into this field. My Highschool offered a ton of opportunities which many students took and helped jumpstart and guide the field they
      wanna persue. If I, Jarred Ramos, could Land a job W/o a background in education or experience in the field all being self taught, then maybe i wont hold my school so accountable for a life i can make for myself.</li>
    <br>
    2. What will I achieve if I learn this skill?
    Which doors will this skill open for you? Will you be able to earn more, have more flexibility in your
    work hours, work remotely and travel more?
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>I could provide a better quality of life for my baby Lani by learning this skill. Hopefully this job will help me land a job as a web dev so I can help contribute to something bigger than just economic gain (i used to work at Amazon...).
    </li>
    <br>
    3. How will this skill change my life and my career?
    Would you get a raise at your current job or more respect from your boss once youâ€™ve learnt this skill?
    Or will you be at Facebook, Amazon or Google instead? How would your life change?
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>learning this skill will bump me up to a real career path as a senior full stack web dev. This will change me life and give it unlimited meaning creating.</li>
    <br>
    4. How will learning this skill impact the lives of my family,
    friends and coworkers?
    What will you be able to do for your family or friends once youâ€™ve learnt this skill? How will it change
    the way they think of you? Will your coworkers respect you more?
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>This goes back to my upbringing and how my elders or anyone who cared about my future career even a little bit, viewed me and my projection in my life as an adult. Only rarely would a teacher or family member take my future seriously. So to
      be able to say im a self-taught web dev for said company who aligns with all my beliefs and so forth would be a huge self confidence booster.
    </li>
    5. How will I feel if I never accomplish this?
    Would you feel disappointed? Would you feel like youâ€™ve missed out?
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Disappointed would be an understatement to a such a waste of effort. I would literally have no sense of self-worth as a human it would be deliberating.</li>
    <br>
    6. What would my life look like if I manage to accomplish this?
    Visualise it. What would life look like from the moment you wake up to the time you go to sleep? Will
    you be living by the sea? Would you kiss your beautiful wife/husband when you wake up?
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>I will not accept a life I dont deserve! I'd be serving cunt on the daily. I see myself making a great cup of coffee to drink while coding, I see my playing with Lani when she demands it! I see my self having a social life thats not toxic to my lifestyle in fact one that enhances my well being and not feel guilty for it.</li>
