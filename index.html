  <P>
    In this section im going to talk about how we get our mornings started (check lvl of Food + Water).
  </P>
  <h4>To-Do List </h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Wake up fatha by stomping on top of his chest <em>with</em> full force!</li>
    <li>Get my Morning Pets from the fatha.</li>
    <li>Start my Yoga Practice as the fatha tells me <strong>"Good Stretch Bubbas!"</strong></li>
    <li>While my fatha has his Morning Joe I too have my Morning 'Nip.</li>
  </ol>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Low Maintance Vibes</h2>
  <br>
  <p>At this time of day fatha has to catches some bread. Meanwhile I definitely don't nap on the job and Serve and Protect this house!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Before fatha has to leave we play for <strong>15mins at a time.</strong></li>
    <li>I don't wanna play all the time and <em>need a bump of 'Nip</em> to get me started.</li>
    <li>Once i'm feeling tuckered out just give me a few minutes bc <strong>im not a <a href="https://senpai.gg/blog/league-of-legends-bruisers-strengths-weaknesses-and-playstyles/#:~:text=SHARE-,League%20of%20Legends%20Bruisers,-are%20champions%20known">bruiser</a></strong> im more of an <a href="https://senpai.gg/blog/league-of-legends-assassins-strengths-weaknesses-and-playstyles/#:~:text=are%20melee%20champions.-,League%20of%20Legends%20Assassins%3A%20Strengths,-Burst%20and%20Mobility">assassin</a> that needs to <strong>recharge my energy</strong> before i can go back in (or else I'll have the <em>zoomiez</em>).</li>
    <li>I really Luv to nap or just hang out so make sure to play w/ me for almost a whole hour a day (doenst have to be all at once either!). In return, as a retired <a href="https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Jujutsu_Sorcerer#:~:text=English-,Jujutsu%20Sorcerer,-VIEW%20SOURCE">JuJu Sourcers</a>, i'll keep away the Cursed Spirits.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>Long at Last</h2>
  <br>
  <p>As the day turns to night, I just have a few more request to ask of you 😿.</p>
  <h4>Cont. To-Do List</h4>
  <ol start="5">
    <li><a href="https://i.redd.it/zocsrond8f771.jpg">Treat time!</a></li>
    <li>Some Nights I still have a little energy or get needy and want some pets after a long day of <em>SLAYING.</em></li>
    <li>If time permits, I put in Overtime and slay the evil spirits downstairs too (just put away the dogs because I slay best alone.)!</li>
  </ol>
